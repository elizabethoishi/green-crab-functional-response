# green-crab-functional-response
This repository contains the associated code, output, and figures for our study investigating functional responses of European green crabs (Carcinus maenas) and the potential impact of external complexity through the addition of substrate on their consumption of two invasive prey species: varnish clams (Nuttallia obscurata) and Japanese littleneck clams (Venerupis philippinarum). 

The clam_burial.csv contains the raw data for a burial depth test to measure the burial depth of 15 clams/species. Clams were allowed to bury over a period of 12 hrs. distance_buried is measured in cm.  VC = varnish clams, JLN = Japanese littleneck clams.

The clam_size.csv contains the raw data for every clam used in the functional response trials. VC = varnish clams, JLN = Japanese littleneck clams. It also contains the data on whether that clam was consumed by a crab or not within its trail (0 = no, 1 = yes)

The crab_consumption_raw2.csv contains the raw data from all functional response trials and replicates. VC = varnish clams, JLN = Japanese littleneck clams. Sediment (1 = present, 0 = absent), Density (number of clams in that trial), CW = carapace width (mm), Cheliped = cheliped height (mm), eaten = number of clams consumed in 8 hrs, alive = number of clams alive after 8 hrs.
